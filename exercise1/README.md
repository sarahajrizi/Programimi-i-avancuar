1. What language you chose and why
1. I choose Python because Python has become the general-purpose programming language for AI development

2. How you used the AI tool (what prompts or methods worked best)
2. I am specific in the things I ask for, I tell what i want and which languange of programming to use, I use examples.

3. What suggestions from the AI were helpful
3. Encapsulated greeting logic in a function

4. What suggestions you had to modify or correct
4. How to reinstall or repair Python in VS, to resolve the "Failed to resolve env"

5. What you learned about AI-assisted coding from this exercise
5. We import the datetime module to retrieve the current date and time.
We define a function greet_user(name) that returns a greeting string.
We handle potential input errors (such as an empty name) using a try-except block.
We include comments for clarity and to meet best practices for documentation.
